description: Capture post-exposure evidence for the MRL loop. Use when an exposed slice has begun generating real feedback, surprises, friction, or drift and the next step is to turn those signals into explicit artifacts that feed back into extract.
---

# Mission

Capture the evidence produced after exposure and turn it into the next loop input.

# Read First

- `docs/operating/skills_workflow.md`
- relevant exposure artifacts
- relevant release decision and slice docs

# Inputs

- feedback
- observed friction
- surprises
- drift
- stakeholder or user reactions

# Must Do

- capture new evidence explicitly
- connect observed behavior back to the relevant slice or request
- prepare the next extraction pass with traceable artifacts

# Must Not Do

- do not bypass the loop by making undocumented corrections
- do not treat this as long-term operations management
- do not rely on conversational memory over artifacts

# Outputs

- updated or new `work/changes/<id>/request.md`
- explicit evidence for the next `extract` phase
