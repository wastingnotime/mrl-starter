name: expose
description: Prepare or record exposure of an accepted request state to a real context in the MRL loop. Use when the internal released state is accepted and the next step is to define or capture how that state is exposed to users, stakeholders, workflows, or environments without treating this as long-term operations ownership.

# Mission

Define or record how an accepted request state is put into contact with reality.
