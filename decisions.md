# Decisions Log

## Purpose

This document records relevant architectural and implementation decisions for the adopting repository.

Use it to preserve reasoning, avoid re-discussing settled trade-offs without context, and document deviations from `architecture.md` and `groundrules.md`.

## DEC-0001 - Separate MRL Core From Implementation Packs

- Date: 2026-03-29
- Status: accepted
- Owners: both

### Context
The starter was presenting Python plus a DDD-inspired modular monolith as if that were the default shape of MRL itself. That creates confusion when a repository needs another language, another architecture such as event sourcing, or more than one runtime.

### Decision
The repository now distinguishes between:

- MRL core, which stays artifact-driven and architecture-agnostic
- implementation packs, which define language, architecture, structure, and testing defaults

The current repository keeps `python_ddd_monolith` as the example selected pack.

### Consequences
It becomes easier to reuse the same refinement workflow across Python, JavaScript, Go, event-sourced, and polyglot client/server repositories. It also becomes necessary to make the selected pack explicit in architecture docs and slice docs.

### Alternatives considered
Keep one universal Python starter and treat every other shape as an undocumented deviation. This was rejected because it would keep conflating MRL with one implementation style.

### Notes
Future pack additions should live under `docs/packs/` and should be referenced by slice documents when the runtime topology matters.

## DEC-0002 - Treat Skill Model Guidance As Advisory

- Date: 2026-04-02
- Status: accepted
- Owners: both

### Context
The repository skills now include model guidance for tasks such as `build`, `refine`, and `extract`. That creates a potential ambiguity: a reader could assume that naming a preferred model in a skill will automatically switch the active Codex model or force sub-agent routing during execution.

### Decision
Model guidance inside repository skills is advisory only. It documents which model shape is usually a good fit for the task, but it does not by itself require automatic model switching, worker spawning, or hard routing behavior.

### Consequences
The skills remain durable even if model names, availability, or routing capabilities change. The repository gains clearer guidance for future operators and tooling, but predictable model selection still requires explicit runtime policy or orchestration outside the skill text.

### Alternatives considered
Encode specific model names in skills as if they were enforced execution rules. This was rejected because skill text alone does not guarantee runtime behavior and would overstate what the repository can currently control.

### Notes
If the repository later wants deterministic skill-to-model routing, document that as a separate operational decision and implement it in the calling workflow or agent orchestration layer.
