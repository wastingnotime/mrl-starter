# MRL Best Practices

## Purpose

This document captures practical guidance for running MRL well.

Use it for habits that improve phase discipline, artifact quality, and architectural timing without changing the core loop definition.

---

## Architecture Timing

A common first-pass mistake is to define the implementation architecture during `extract`.

That usually compresses `extract`, `refine`, and part of `build` into one step.

A better default is:

- `extract` identifies domain signals, constraints, tensions, and architectural pressures
- `refine` turns those pressures into explicit architecture and slice decisions
- `build` implements only the architecture needed for the current slice

### What belongs in `extract`

Capture facts such as:

- fixed language or runtime constraints
- existing system boundaries
- latency or authority pressures
- external protocol requirements
- deployment or platform constraints that are already decided outside the lab

These are extracted constraints, not internal architecture choices.

### What belongs in `refine`

Decide only as far as needed for the next slice:

- authority model
- protocol shape
- pack selection
- runtime split
- persistence style
- client/server responsibility split
- event, command, or snapshot boundaries

Architecture is usually an interpretation of extracted evidence, so it should normally become explicit here.

### What must not happen in `build`

`build` should not silently redesign the architecture.

If implementation pressure forces a meaningful architectural change, push that back into:

- the current slice definition
- `decisions.md`
- or a return to `refine`

---

## Practical Rule

Use this test:

- if it is a discovered fact, keep it in `extract`
- if it is a chosen shape, decide it in `refine`
- if it is only needed to make the current slice executable, implement it in `build`

---

## Example

For a browser game with a Go backend:

### `extract`

Capture:

- browser client is required
- backend must be Go
- low-latency movement matters
- anti-cheat or authoritative validation matters
- real-time transport is required

### `refine`

Decide:

- authoritative server simulation
- WebSocket protocol
- client prediction rules
- reconciliation strategy
- which collisions are predicted locally and which are authoritative remotely

### `build`

Implement one thin slice such as:

- player moves
- player collides with one power-up
- server validates and applies the effect
- client reconciles rendered state

---

## Why This Matters

This separation keeps:

- `extract` evidence-oriented
- `refine` design-oriented
- `build` execution-oriented

That usually reduces accidental early lock-in and makes architecture easier to evolve.

---

## Validation Surface

Do not assume every slice should be validated the same way.

Some systems are mostly validated through structural evidence such as tests, logs, and state inspection.
Others need interaction, timing, and lived use to expose expectation gaps reliably.

Use `docs/evaluation/validation_modes.md` to classify whether the current project or slice is:

- headless-first
- interaction-assisted
- interaction-dependent

This affects:

- how slices should be scoped
- how often built artifacts should be run and inspected
- whether frontend and backend should stay closely coupled during construction

---

## Session Productivity

If a repository wants lightweight operational feedback on how MRL work is progressing, track session metrics alongside normal artifact review.

Use `docs/session_metrics.md` as the starter pattern for:

- token-efficiency tracking
- historical session snapshots
- simple investigation thresholds when sessions become expensive or drift-prone

These metrics should guide inspection of session shape, not replace review of slice quality, model quality, or delivered behavior.
